This contains my settings (fonts, keyboard shortcuts, etc) for the IDE's I use:

 - Visual Studio + Resharper: this is what I have used for ~4 years professionally - I definitely haven't customized as much as I should, but this works pretty well for me day-to-day.
 
 - IntelliJ IDEA: I started using this when I began learning Scala about 6 months ago - I chose JetBrains' product since I've enjoyed Resharper so much. This is seriously uncustomized and I haven't the foggiest idea what you can do with this program, it seems insanely powerful (or so my one-click install of complete GitHub integration seems to indicate).
 
 - DrRacket: Been using DrRacket for about a year and half now, this is mostly just a color scheme change. But _what_ a color scheme change! It's pretty much the same as the other two.
 
DISCLAIMER: these might not be my most shiniest, up-to-date settings. This is just whatever I have on my laptop right now - especially with Racket it's hard to tell since I'm always installing new builds.
