This is far from a full Javascript parser. It parses basically JSON + a bunch of arithmetic + function application, etc., but is missing on basically everything else. It was a nice way to continue to get my feet wet with parser combinators, parsing, and F#, but I realized that a full JavaScript implementation (or even parser) was a surprisingly big pain in the ass for little interest on my part. Incidentally, I have since done several parsers for this sort of functional C-like grammar at work and my initial assessment that it is not very fun was indeed correct. Might be useful if you want to see how to do some slightly larger things in FParsec than the tutorials they offer on the site (last I checked, which was a long time ago).
