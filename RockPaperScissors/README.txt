This is a program that's supposed to play rock, paper, scissors against you and kick your ass. Some friends and I were given a link to some website (NYTimes, perhaps?) that was touting some AI they said could play a mean game of RPS. After we all did better than even (for an extended period) against the AI, we started talking about what would make a good RPS program. I took some of these ideas and tried 'em out in F#. The result I remember as being very good but I seem to be able to beat this current version easily. I can't figure out what happened - I'm guessing some refactoring change let the magic smoke out or else this is an old copy of the program and the real one is lost in the void.
