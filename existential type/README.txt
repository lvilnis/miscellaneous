I was messing around with typed racket, one of the few languages I know that includes higher-rank polymorphism, and I did a little encoding of existentials using universals. The macro is silly because I just wanted to see the "(Exists ...)" vs "(All ...)" syntax next to each other - it would take a lot of work to get "Exists" to actually work as a real type quantifier and make it play nicely with the rest of Typed Racket. So this is a bit of a cute hack and not really anything noteworthy, but I do so love to play with Typed Racket's mix of features. They are truly eclectic and powerful - it is especially hard to go back to a language with tagged unions after using untagged ones + occurrence typing.
