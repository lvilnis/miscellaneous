Drawing random pictures using functional programming: here's some Typed Racket that uses the very neat variable-arity polymorphism to construct a variadic version of fmap, and uses that to draw random pictures using the idea of applicative functors and Racket's drawing libraries. Last I tried it out, TR's type checker couldn't quite keep up with the gymnastics without requiring way too many type annotations, which kind of defeats the point, so we're running in non type-checked mode unfortunately (but the spirit of statically typed FP remains). This also may be missing some utility methods because IIRC it was chopped up several times while writing a blog post.
